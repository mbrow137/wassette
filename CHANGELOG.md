### Fixed
- Memory resource limiter implementation by properly applying limits to Wasmtime store using the correct `limiter()` API ([#171](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/171))

### Changed
- CLI now supports both server mode (`wassette serve`) and direct management mode for component operations
- Component load/unload operations can now work independently without requiring a running MCP server
- Enhanced help text and command structure with logical grouping of related functionality
