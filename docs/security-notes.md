# Security Review: Wassette MCP Server CLI

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Review Date:** December 2024  
**Scope:** Full security assessment of Wassette ModelContextProtocol (MCP) server implementation

## Executive Summary

Wassette is a security-oriented MCP server that provides sandboxed execution of WebAssembly components to enable safe tool integration for AI agents. This comprehensive security review assesses the current security posture, identifies potential risks, and provides recommendations for enhancing the system's security resilience.

**Overall Security Rating:** MODERATE with strong foundational security controls but several areas requiring attention.

### Key Strengths
- **Strong Sandboxing**: WebAssembly-based isolation via Wasmtime engine
- **Capability-Based Security**: Fine-grained permission controls for network, storage, and environment access
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers from WASM to HTTP filtering
- **Memory Safety**: Rust implementation provides memory safety guarantees

### Primary Concerns
- **Component Loading Attack Surface**: Multiple untrusted input vectors
- **Policy Management Vulnerabilities**: Dynamic permission granting without sufficient validation
- **Transport Security Gaps**: Limited authentication and authorization for MCP clients
- **Supply Chain Risks**: OCI registry and HTTPS component loading without signature verification

---

## 1. Threat Model

### 1.1 Actors and Trust Boundaries

#### Trusted Actors
- **Host System Administrator**: Full control over Wassette deployment and configuration
- **MCP Client Applications**: AI agents/tools that communicate with Wassette server (currently trusted)

#### Untrusted Actors
- **WebAssembly Components**: Third-party tools loaded into the sandbox
- **External Registries**: OCI repositories and HTTPS sources serving components
- **Network Endpoints**: External services accessed by components

#### Trust Boundaries
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     Host System         │ ← Trusted Domain
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Wassette MCP Server   │ ← Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
├─────────────────────────┤
│  WebAssembly Runtime    │ ← Security Boundary
├─────────────────────────┤
│   WASM Components       │ ← Untrusted Domain
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### 1.2 Assets Under Protection

#### Primary Assets
- **Host System Integrity**: Prevent compromise of the underlying system
- **Data Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive data accessible through file system permissions
- **Network Resources**: Control outbound network access from components
- **System Availability**: Prevent resource exhaustion and denial of service

#### Secondary Assets
- **Component Integrity**: Ensure loaded components haven't been tampered with
- **Policy Consistency**: Maintain security policy enforcement
- **Audit Trail**: Preserve logging for security monitoring

### 1.3 Attack Vectors

#### High Priority Vectors
1. **Malicious Component Loading**: Loading compromised WASM components
2. **Policy Bypass**: Circumventing permission restrictions
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: CPU/memory bombing via components
4. **Path Traversal**: Escaping file system sandboxes
5. **Network Policy Evasion**: Bypassing network access controls

#### Medium Priority Vectors
1. **MCP Protocol Exploitation**: Malicious MCP client behavior
2. **Transport Layer Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle on HTTP/HTTPS
3. **Component Registry Compromise**: Supply chain attacks
4. **Permission Escalation**: Gradual accumulation of excessive permissions

## 2. Current Security Posture Assessment

### 2.1 Sandboxing and Isolation

#### ✅ Strengths
- **WebAssembly Sandboxing**: Leverages Wasmtime's battle-tested WASM runtime
- **WASI Isolation**: Components run in isolated WASI environments
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety prevents buffer overflows and use-after-free
- **Capability-Based Access**: Fine-grained control over file, network, and environment access

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Resource Limits**: No apparent CPU/memory quotas for components
- **System Call Filtering**: Limited control over WASI system calls
- **Side-Channel Protections**: No specific mitigations for timing/cache attacks

### 2.2 Component Loading Security

#### ✅ Current Controls
- **URI Validation**: Basic scheme validation (file://, https://, oci://)
- **File Extension Validation**: Enforces .wasm extension
- **Path Validation**: Requires absolute paths for local files
- **HTTPS Support**: Secure transport for web-based loading

#### 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities
- **No Signature Verification**: Components loaded without cryptographic validation
- **Unvalidated HTTPS**: No certificate pinning or additional verification
- **Registry Trust**: Implicit trust in OCI registries without authentication
- **Component Integrity**: No hash verification or tamper detection

#### Code Example - Vulnerable Loading:
```rust
// In loader.rs - no signature verification
async fn from_url(url: &str, http_client: &reqwest::Client) -> Result<DownloadedResource> {
    let resp = http_client.get(url).send().await?;
    // Downloads and loads without any integrity verification
}
```

### 2.3 Permission System

#### ✅ Robust Policy Framework
- **Per-Component Policies**: Individual policy files for each component
- **Allow/Deny Lists**: Explicit permission granting for resources
- **Policy Validation**: Schema validation for policy documents
- **Runtime Enforcement**: Dynamic permission checking

#### ⚠️ Security Gaps
- **Dynamic Permission Granting**: Tools can request additional permissions at runtime
- **Policy File Security**: No integrity protection for policy files
- **Permission Accumulation**: No limits on total permissions granted
- **Validation Bypass**: Some edge cases in URI/path validation

#### Vulnerable Permission Granting:
```rust
// In policy_internal.rs - trusts user input
pub async fn grant_permission(
    &self,
    component_id: &str,
    permission_type: &str,
    details: &serde_json::Value, // Unvalidated user input
) -> Result<()>
```

### 2.4 Network Security

#### ✅ Network Controls
- **HTTP Filtering**: Policy-based outbound HTTP request filtering
- **Host Allowlisting**: Per-component allowed hosts configuration
- **Protocol Restrictions**: Scheme-specific host filtering
- **Request Blocking**: Proper error handling for denied requests

#### ⚠️ Network Vulnerabilities
- **No Rate Limiting**: Components can make unlimited requests
- **DNS Rebinding**: No protection against DNS-based attacks
- **IPv6/IPv4 Confusion**: Limited handling of dual-stack environments
- **Subdomain Wildcarding**: Limited wildcard support in host filtering

### 2.5 Transport Security

#### ✅ Available Transports
- **Multiple Protocols**: stdio, SSE, HTTP support
- **TLS Dependencies**: Uses rustls for HTTPS client connections

#### 🚨 Critical Gaps
- **No Authentication**: MCP clients connect without authentication
- **No Authorization**: All authenticated clients have full access
- **Unencrypted Transports**: stdio and local HTTP are unencrypted
- **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against DoS attacks on transports

## 8. Conclusion

Wassette demonstrates a strong foundation for secure WebAssembly component execution with its capability-based access control and sandboxing approach. However, several critical security gaps require immediate attention, particularly around component signature verification and client authentication.

### Priority Actions
1. **Implement component signature verification** (Critical)
2. **Add MCP client authentication** (Critical)
3. **Implement resource quotas** (High)
4. **Enhance path validation** (High)
5. **Add security monitoring** (Medium)

### Long-term Vision
With proper implementation of the recommended security controls, Wassette can become a best-in-class secure execution platform for AI agent tools, setting industry standards for WebAssembly-based sandboxing and capability-based security.

### Risk Acceptance
The current implementation should only be deployed in trusted environments until critical security controls are implemented. Production deployments should wait for signature verification and authentication features.
